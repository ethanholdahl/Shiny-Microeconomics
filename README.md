# Shiny-Microeconomics

This repository contains the code for the application [Shiny Micro](https://ethanholdahl.shinyapps.io/Intermediate_Micro/). 

It is intended as a resource both for students learning micro and for instructors teaching micro as a way to quicky generate beautiful graphs depecting the concepts covered in an Intermediate Microeconomics course.

The project is currently in it's infancy and as such lacks many of the features I plan to build. Among those are: wrapping the collection of functions I've written into a R package for R users, adding more micro topics to the site, adding an assessment tool and step-by-step solutions to problems, creating a user friendly interface to create download or print ready graphs for every topic covered in the site.
